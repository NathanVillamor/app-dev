## Rick & Morty 
> " Your "boos" mean nothing. I've seen what makes you cheer!" - Rick Sanchez

Rick and Morty, a dark sci-fi cartoon from Adult Swim, Cartoon Network's nighttime block. 
It follows a grandfather, Rick Sanchez, and grandson, Morty Smith, duo that explores impossible
dimensions that makes them grow, or show their true selves.

I love this series because it explores mature themes and concepts about life in an exaggerated
but still relatable manner. Additionally, I love how the cartoon isn't afraid of including 
dark humor in every episode. Its unapolegetic nature makes me adore the creators so much 
because they are not afraid of being direct about the things that they explore inside the series.
This is one of the most honest series/franchises that I have ever watched, and I shall continue
to support and love the show for its entirety.
